# Donk Project

The goal of Donk Project is to create a clean-room implementation of the
BYOND platform, and a transpiler which can convert Dreammaker source code
into code that can run on that implementation.

The project is currently *API-unstable* and unreleased.

For more information, see https://donk-project.github.io, and README files in
subdirectories.
